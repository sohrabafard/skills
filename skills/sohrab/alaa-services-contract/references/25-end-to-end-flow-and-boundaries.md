# End-To-End Flow And Boundaries

Use this file when the task is about how the Ala platform fits together end-to-end, especially for onboarding an agent or a frontend developer to the shared system shape.

## High-level system view

The Ala platform is organized in layers with clear ownership:
- client applications send public traffic to the gateway
- the gateway is the external trust boundary
- the gateway verifies access tokens for protected routes, removes untrusted internal headers, injects trusted identity and project context, and forwards requests to the right backend
- when a route family needs fine-grained request-time authorization, the gateway calls `authz-sidecar` or `entitlement-spoa`
- backend services own their business domains and internal logic
- entitlement-platform keeps normalized authorization business truth in `entitlement-api`, projects derived tuples through `projector`, and serves request-time checks from OpenFGA

Rules:
- do not let services recreate browser-facing trust assumptions on internal hops
- keep route ownership clear so frontend, gateway, and backend work stay aligned
- prefer direct ownership boundaries over convenience coupling across service internals
- backend services may keep local user projections or immutable request snapshots, but `auth` remains the source of truth for current identity state

## Current services and responsibilities

### Existing services

- `auth`
  - canonical auth and profile source of truth for sign-in, tokens, sessions, profile truth, and trusted identity APIs
- `content`
  - new macroservice for `course`, `set`, and `content`
- `vod`
  - legacy learning and playback service during migration; on the deprecation path for learning-content ownership
- `comment`
  - discussion service for comments, replies, likes, moderation, and related activity
- `ticket`
  - support service for ticket creation, replies, assignment, status changes, and follow-up flows
- `wa`
  - watch and analytics ingestion service for event intake and related processing flows
- `entitlement-api`
  - normalized authorization business truth
- `projector`
  - derived tuple writer into OpenFGA
- OpenFGA
  - derived authorization graph for fast request-time checks

### Components being evaluated

These are not yet stable ownership surfaces, but they should follow the same platform contract where relevant:
- `notification-core`
- `realtime-hub`
- delivery workers
- queue or broker backbones such as RabbitMQ or Redis Streams

## Baseline platform flow

Treat the default Ala flow like this:
- public client or frontend -> gateway -> backend service
- gateway -> request-time authorization runtime such as `authz-sidecar` or `entitlement-spoa` when the route family uses entitlement-platform authorization
- backend service -> backend service only for internal workloads that truly require a synchronous hop
- backend service -> async infrastructure for queue, event, or job delivery when appropriate
- normalized business change -> `entitlement-api` -> `projector` -> OpenFGA for derived fine-grained authorization state

## Simple user journey

In a normal user journey:
- a learner calls a gateway-facing route
- if the route is protected, the gateway verifies the token, strips spoofed internal headers, injects trusted context such as `X-User-Id` and `X-Project-Id`, and decides whether request-time authorization is also required
- sign-in and token refresh flows reach `auth`
- learning-page data should reach `content` in the long-term platform direction, while some migration traffic may still pass through `vod`
- discussion actions reach `comment`
- support actions reach `ticket`
- watch or telemetry ingestion reaches `wa`
- protected route families that use fine-grained authorization are checked first by `authz-sidecar` or `entitlement-spoa`, using the derived authorization state stored in OpenFGA

From the user point of view, this feels like one product. Inside the platform, each layer keeps a clear responsibility.

## How entitlement-platform fits into the Ala stack

- entitlement-platform does not own authentication; the gateway does
- entitlement-platform may own request-time fine-grained route authorization through `authz-sidecar` or `entitlement-spoa`
- entitlement-platform keeps normalized authorization business truth in `entitlement-api`
- `projector` writes derived tuples
- OpenFGA stores derived effective authorization state

For a normal backend behind gateway, the practical rule is:
- trust the gateway authentication result
- trust the gateway allow or deny result for the route
- normalize trusted identity context once near ingress
- still enforce business authorization, validation, and data-safety rules inside the backend

Do not make a normal backend behave like the gateway, the request-time checker, or the entitlement control plane unless the repository explicitly owns that role.

## Frontend and gateway orientation

Rules:
- frontend clients call documented gateway-facing routes, not service-local routes discovered from backend repos
- frontend clients must never generate or rely on trusted internal headers such as `X-Project-Id`, `X-User-Id`, `X-Access`, `X-User-Mobile`, `X-User-Fname`, `X-User-Lname`, or `X-Location-*`
- trusted headers belong to the gateway-to-service contract, not the public client contract
- if a route is operational, frontend clients must not treat it as product behavior
- if a route previously depended on the retired profile blob, move that client integration to the public auth or profile APIs instead of reviving `X-Profile`

Route-shape reminder:
- gateway-facing routes may include a service prefix such as `/auth`, `/content`, `/comment`, `/ticket`, `/vod`, or `/wa`
- that first service prefix is a gateway routing prefix, not necessarily a backend route prefix and not necessarily the same concept as a child SDK `servicePrefix`, `apiPrefix`, or fixed ingest path
- clients and SDKs should compose the public gateway path exactly once through existing public configuration seams, such as service base URLs or child route-prefix options, without changing child SDK/service route definitions just to satisfy gateway routing
- trusted internal routes stay service-owned and are not public frontend discovery surfaces
- operational routes remain separate from product routes even when they share the `/api/*` prefix
- service-local routes may differ after gateway prefix stripping
- when `stripPathPrefix: true`, the gateway routes on the public prefixed path, strips only the configured gateway prefix, and forwards the remaining backend-visible service-local path
- do not collapse or de-duplicate repeated path segments at runtime; if a duplicate segment appears, decide whether it is intentional public-vs-child route composition or a bad config, then fix the config seam rather than rewriting paths ad hoc
- for client SDK and frontend package work, do not change child SDK source or backend routes to add a gateway prefix; prefer public config such as core `baseUrls`, child `servicePrefix`/`apiPrefix`, or service-specific path options
- if a child path is fixed, as with WA ingest, apply the gateway prefix through the service base URL
- before claiming a prefix is active in an environment, verify the gateway route table and rendered HAProxy config when available; in the current local convention this usually means checking `D:/Sohrab/Project/gateway/charts/gateway/values*.yaml`, `D:/Sohrab/Project/gateway/docker/values.shared-network.yaml`, and rendered `gateway.loadbalancer.yaml` or `gateway.ingress.yaml`
- use `$alaa-trust-gateway-auth` for exact trusted-ingress and prefix-strip behavior when the task depends on those details; use `$alaa-haproxy` when actual HAProxy routing, ACL order, or path rewriting is in scope

## Operational caller expectations

`GET /api/health` and `GET /api/ready` exist for:
- gateway and ingress probes
- orchestrators and rollout automation
- runtime validation scripts
- smoke checks
- automated tests

Rules:
- end-user clients should not depend on these routes for product behavior
- `/api/ready` is an operational contract and must not turn into a login helper, feature-flag probe, or frontend preflight endpoint
- the contract must not assume one specific operational caller

## Internal hop discipline

Rules:
- preserve `X-Request-Id` and `traceparent` across internal HTTP hops
- keep trusted header parsing and normalization close to the receiving edge
- keep operational routes separate from product-facing routes
- do not proxy another service's `/api/ready` unless that dependency is an explicit approved rollout requirement
- if a service depends on shared infrastructure such as Redis or RabbitMQ, check that infrastructure directly instead of proxying another app's status
- if a frontend or service needs domain behavior from another service, prefer that service's public API or events over direct table coupling
- downstream services may consume compact trusted name and location headers, but they must not fabricate display-name fields from compact ids unless another explicit source-of-truth contract owns that lookup
- backend services may keep local user projections or immutable request snapshots, but `auth` remains the source of truth for the latest identity state

## Repo-role reminders

### Frontend repository

- call gateway-facing public routes only
- never generate trusted internal headers
- never call `authz-sidecar`, `entitlement-spoa`, or OpenFGA directly

### Gateway repository

- own authentication, spoofing defense, trusted-header injection, and request-time authorization inputs
- keep request-time authorization fail-closed

### Backend service behind gateway

- consume normalized trusted context
- keep controllers and policies away from raw header parsing
- do not use allow-side `X-Authz-*` metadata as authorization input

### Entitlement-platform repository

- own fine-grained authorization contracts, request-time checker behavior, and tuple projection rules
- do not turn OpenFGA into business truth

## Why this file exists

This file gives one concise picture of:
- what the public client is allowed to do
- what the gateway owns
- what backend services own
- how `content` and legacy `vod` fit during migration
- where async boundaries belong

That helps agents keep frontend, gateway, and backend work consistent instead of treating each repository as an isolated system.
